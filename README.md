# OnlineFoodOrderingSystem

In this project, I applied CherryPy/Python web framework, Javascript/Ajax, jQuery, HTML, CSS, and MySQLto develop an online food ordering system. 

Implemented REST APIs for different resources like restaurant, menu, category, food item, order, customer. 

Built the front-end UI and back-end database. If you have any question, please feel free to contact me at cluo1@nd.edu.
