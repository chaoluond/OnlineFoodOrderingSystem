# OnlineFoodOrderingSystem

In this project, I applied CherryPy web framework to develop an online food ordering system. Implemented REST APIs for restaurant, menu, category, food item, order, customer. Built the front-end UI and back-end database. If you have any question, please feel free to contact me at cluo1@nd.edu.
